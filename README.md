# Pinecone AI Starter: Learn RAG by Building

**Build a Production-Ready RAG System in 8 Phases** 🚀

This isn't just another boilerplate — it's a **hands-on learning experience** where you'll build a complete Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system from scratch. Perfect for developers who want to **master AI engineering** by actually building something real.

---

## What You'll Build

**Phase 1-8 Progression:** Each phase adds a core RAG component
```
📄 Text → 🔢 Vectors → 🗄️ Storage → 🔍 Search → 🤖 AI Answers
```

**By the end, you'll have:**
- ✅ Text embedding service (OpenAI)
- ✅ Vector database (Pinecone) 
- ✅ Semantic search API
- ✅ Complete RAG pipeline
- ✅ Evaluation metrics
- ✅ Production deployment

---

## Why This Approach Works

### 🎯 **Learning by Doing**
- **8 bite-sized phases** — No overwhelming complexity
- **Working code at each step** — See immediate results
- **Real integrations** — Not toy examples
- **Production patterns** — Learn industry best practices

### 📈 **Skills You'll Master**
- Vector embeddings & similarity search
- Pinecone vector database operations
- OpenAI API integration
- Firebase Cloud Functions
- TypeScript API development
- RAG pipeline architecture
- Retrieval evaluation metrics

## Quick Start (5 Minutes)

```bash
# 1. Clone & setup
git clone <your-repo>
cd pinecone-ai-starter
cd functions && npm install

# 2. Add your API keys (free tiers work!)
cp .env.sample .env
# Edit .env: Add OpenAI + Pinecone keys

# 3. Start building!
npm run dev  # Local development server
```

**First milestone:** `POST /embed` working in under 10 minutes!

## The 8-Phase API

```javascript
// Phase 1: Get embeddings
POST /embed
{"text": "What is RAG?"}
// → {"embedding": [0.1, -0.2, ...], "dimensions": 1536}

// Phase 4: Semantic search  
POST /search
{"query": "RAG explanation", "topK": 3}
// → {"results": [{"text": "...", "score": 0.89}]}

// Phase 5: Complete RAG
POST /rag/query
{"query": "Explain RAG simply"}
// → {"answer": "RAG is...", "context": [...]}
```
